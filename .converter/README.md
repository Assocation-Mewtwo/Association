Hello!

This is a small app that allows you to quickly convert google drive share links
for images into useable links for the src attributes of image elements in
HTML5 for entry into the weight_image table of the Association database!

1. Upload the file of your choice, keep them small, to the share drive you want to reference

2. Make sure the share is set to anyone with link can view

3. Run the index.html file, 'Live Server' works well

4. Copy the image share link into the input that says 'copy sharelink here'

5. Fill out the other input fields with the image details they request

6. Click the button to gernerate your SQL code

NOTE: If an image does not display above the SQL code then the link did not work
